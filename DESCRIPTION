Description: Twitter polls allow for four answer options, allowing users to
    design a "2x2" poll, where two questions are actually asked, each with two
    potential answers. Answers to such a poll can be arranged in a contingency
    table, where the number of responses for each option are put in a cell of a
    matrix with two columns (one for each potential answer to one question) and
    two rows (one for each potential answer to the other question). There are
    a number of statistical techniques that can be applied to such data to test
    the hypothesis that answers to the two questions are related.
    'TwitterPollTester' provides tools to fetch the poll responses from Twitter
    and test whether answers to the two questions are independent or related.
